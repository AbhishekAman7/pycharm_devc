In PyCharm, if you have multiple Python files in your project and you want to control which one runs first, here’s exactly how to do it:

⸻

Step-by-step: Set the main Python file to run

1. Right-click the file you want to run

Let’s say you have a file called main.py or worker.py.
	•	Right-click it in the Project Explorer
	•	Click “Run ‘main’” (or whatever the file is called)

PyCharm will now:
	•	Create a Run Configuration for this file
	•	Execute it using the project interpreter

⸻

2. Set it as the default run configuration (optional)

Once it’s run once, you can make it the default:
	•	Go to the top-right dropdown in the PyCharm toolbar (shows your recent runs)
	•	Select the one you want (e.g., main)
	•	Click Edit Configurations…
	•	In the dialog:
	•	Make sure the script path points to your desired file (e.g., main.py)
	•	You can rename it for clarity (like “Run Main App”)
	•	Click Apply, then OK

Now you can just press Shift + F10 or click the green play button to run it.

⸻

3. Automatically run a specific file when project opens (optional)

This isn’t typical in Python projects, but if you want to auto-run a file:
	•	Use Edit Configurations… and configure a Before Launch task like running a script.
	•	Or use File > Settings > Tools > Startup Tasks to run a command when the project opens (available in PyCharm Pro with some plugins).

⸻

Pro Tip: Use if __name__ == "__main__"

Make sure your entry files use:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()  # or whatever logic you want to trigger

So PyCharm (or any runner) knows how to treat it when executed directly.

⸻

Let me know if you’re using Docker, remote interpreters, or devcontainers inside PyCharm — setup can vary slightly.
Devcontainers don’t automatically run any Python file unless you explicitly tell them to.
They just define the environment — not the application entry point.

⸻

How it works under the hood:
	1.	devcontainer.json defines environment setup, not execution
The devcontainer.json file might look like:

{
  "name": "My Python Project",
  "image": "python:3.11",
  "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt"
}

This creates a container and installs dependencies — but does not specify what Python file to run.

⸻

	2.	You decide what to run manually or via config
After the container spins up:
	•	You (the developer) run a Python file manually (e.g., python worker.py)
	•	Or, you configure the devcontainer to run a specific file using:

"postStartCommand": "python main.py"

Or if you’re using a task:

"postStartCommand": "pnpm dev"  // if you're in a JS/TS world



⸻

	3.	VS Code tasks or launch.json can define entry points
Inside .vscode/launch.json, you might define:

{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Python: main.py",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/main.py"
    }
  ]
}

This tells VS Code to run main.py when debugging.

⸻

So, with 10 Python files…
	•	Devcontainers won’t “choose” one — it’s up to you.
	•	You define the startup script in one of:
	•	postStartCommand (in devcontainer.json)
	•	.vscode/launch.json
	•	Your Dockerfile CMD (if you’re containerizing the app)

⸻

Typical pattern:

If you’re using a Dockerfile for production behavior inside the devcontainer:

CMD ["python", "main.py"]

This is the real way to tell the container what to run by default.

⸻

Want help designing a devcontainer that auto-runs the correct Python file when the container starts? Just tell me your folder structure and desired entry file.
⸻

1. sleep infinity just keeps the process alive

In your worker.py file, if it has something like:

import time
time.sleep(float("inf"))

This just tells Python to sleep forever, effectively keeping the process alive. PyCharm is running this as a standalone script, not necessarily as part of your main application logic.

⸻

2. PyCharm runs files based on what you tell it

Even if there’s no reference to worker.py from other files in your project, you can right-click it and run it, and PyCharm will:
	•	Use the Python interpreter
	•	Execute that file as a script
	•	Maintain the process until it completes (or is forcefully stopped)

This is standard behavior for PyCharm — every file is an entry point if it has runnable Python code.

⸻

3. IntelliJ/PyCharm doesn’t need imports to run a file

Unlike Java (where a main() class must be explicitly specified and files need to be linked), in Python:
	•	Each .py file is treated as a potential script.
	•	You don’t need another file to import worker.py for it to run.
	•	PyCharm just launches python worker.py, and that’s enough.

⸻

4. Use Case: Why use sleep infinity in worker.py?

Often used when:
	•	You’re testing background workers or services
	•	You’re simulating a daemon process
	•	You’re containerizing and want the container to stay alive (like in Docker)

So maybe your worker.py is being launched to simulate a long-running service for testing or orchestration.

⸻

Bonus: Check your run configuration

If you’re not right-clicking and manually running worker.py, it’s possible PyCharm has a Run Configuration (visible top-right) that points to it. Check:
	•	Run > Edit Configurations
	•	See if worker.py is set as the target script

⸻

If you want, you can share your worker.py and how you’re running it, and I’ll help explain what’s happening under the hood.
